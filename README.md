Great centralized place to put in tidbits of scripts that can be ran from anywhere:

* **Bash** using `source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PageUpPeopleOrg/gists/master/YOUR-SCRIPT-HERE.sh)`
* **Powershell** using `iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PageUpPeopleOrg/gists/master/YOUR-SCRIPT-HERE.ps1'))`

Please don't add any sensitive data in here.
